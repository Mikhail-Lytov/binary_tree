## Binary search tree ##
***Task:*** implement the ***binary_tree*** class, which would provide
logarithmic complexity of searching and adding a new
element.
Instructions for implementation:
- the laboratory work consists of two files:
***binary_tree.java *** — description of the binary_tree class, prototypes
  methods, implementation of methods;
  ***test-binary_tree.java *** — testing and verification of capabilities
  class;
- create an auxiliary template structure containing
  a field for storing values of any type and 2 fields for
storing references to the left and right descendants;
- the ***binary_tree*** class must be a template;
- the ***binary_tree*** class must contain the following fields:
a reference to the root element;
  number of elements in the tree;
- the ***binary_tree*** class must contain the following methods:
  designer;
  copy constructor;
  adding an element;
  element search;
  deleting all elements;
  required interfaces;
